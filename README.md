# NightlyHerb's Blog Posts

This repo contains the markdown files for my blog posts.

I intend this repo to contain good old markdown files
with a simple matter on top of it
because I'd like my content separate from UI libraries.

This is because:

-   The tech stack to present my content is not deacided yet
    and I wanted to make posts beforehand.

-   I did consider mdx documents
    as it seems to give you more power on how to present your content,
    but I wasn't certain that I could get much use out of it
    for my future blog posts.
